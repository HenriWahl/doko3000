# doko3000

Simple Doppelkopf deck simulation via web browser

## Overview

The 2020 coronavirus pandemic spring lockdown forced us to move our Doppelkopf meetings from real world to online.
Doko3000 helps to keep the ongoing league competition going.

It just provides a **virtual table** with **virtual cards**. Players play like in the real world, preferably talking to each
other via video conference in a parallel window.
**No rules** are included, because there are so many. For the same reason there are **no scoreboards** or statistics.
It will even feel more familiar if somebody of your card gang notes the score as before.

To mitigate the pandemic somewhat, doko3000 is intended to be **as digital as necessary, as analog as possible**.

Ingame language at the moment is only german due to Doppelkopf being a mostly german phenomenon. Might change in the future.
